* COMMENT Some intuition and motivation
** What are graphs
*** Dotas connected with lines or arrows
    - Try ~graph G { node[stype=filled, color=green] ...}~
    #+NAME: house
    #+BEGIN_SRC dot :file "tmp0.png"
    graph G {  
    node[stype=filled, color=green]
    a,b,c }
    #+END_SRC

*** So what do we need?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_OPT: allowframebreaks
    :END:
**** Vertices
     - The dots are called *vertices* or *vertexes* or *nodes*
     - The set of vertices is $V$
       # #+CALL_house()
**** Edges
     - The lines between vertices are *edges*
     - We will have both
       - undirected edges (lines) and
       - directed edges (arrows)
     - The set of edges is $E$
**** Why do we need edges
     - Is it possible to define the edges as \(E \subset V\times V\)?
       - E.g. the edge between 1 and 2 is the pair $(1,2)$
       - or if the graph is undirected, then $\{1,2\}$ 
       - Yes, sometimes... but we want a definition as general as
	 possible
     - But what if we want more then one edge between two vertices

* Un\-directed graphs
** Basic definitions
*** Definition of an undirected graph
**** Undirected graph
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
    An *undirected graph* or (just a) *graph* is a $G=(\varphi,E,V)$
    triplet, where
    - $V$ is the *set of vertices*, 
    - $E$ is the *set of edges* and
    - $\varphi:E\to \wp(V)$ is the *connection map*, so that
      $\varphi(e)=\{v_1,v_2\}\subseteq V$ for each $e\in E$.
**** Remark
     $E=\dmn(\varphi)$ is always true.
*** Terminology

    :BEAMER_OPT: allowframebreaks
    :END:
**** Connection and endpoints 				       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     If $e\in E$ we have $v\in \varphi(e)$, then *the edge $e$ is
     connected to the vertex $v$* or *the vertex $v$ is an endpoint of
     edge $e$*.
**** Isolated vertex 					       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     If no edge is connected to $v\in V$, then $v$ is an *isolated
     vertex*.
**** Empty graph 					       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     If $E=\emptyset$ \ie it has no edges, then it is an *empty
     graph*.
*** Some questions
**** Why the complicated definition
     - Do we need $E$?
*** Adjacency
**** Adjacency of edges 				       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Two different *edges $e_1$ and $e_2$ are adjacent* if
     $\varphi(e_1)\cap\varphi(e_2)\neq\emptyset$, \ie there is a
     common vertex to which they are connected to.
**** Adjacency of vertices 				       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Similarly, two different *vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ are adjacent*
     if $\varphi(e)=\{v_1,v_2\}$, \ie if there is a common edge of
     which they are endpoints of.
*** Simple graphs and multi\-graphs
**** Loops, parallel edges 				       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     - An edge connected to only one vertex is called a *loop*.
     - Two different edges $e_1$ and $e_2$ are *parallel* if
       $\varphi(e_1)=\varphi(e_2)$ \ie they are connected to the same
       vertices.
**** Simple graph, multi\-graph 			       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     - A graph is *simple* if contain no loops an no parallel edges.
     - A graph is a *multi\-graph* if it contains loops or parallel edges.
*** Finite and infinite graph
**** Finite and infinite graph 				       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     - If the number of elements in both $E$ and $V$ is finite, then we
       have a *finite graph*, otherwise it is an *infinite graph*.
     - If not stated otherwise, all graphs mentioned will be finite.  
*** A function on a set of vertices
**** A function on a set of vertices 			       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     - For a graph $G=(\varphi,E,V)$ and $S\subseteq V$, let \[
       E(S)=\bigl\{e \in E : \exists v \in S \land \exists v' \in E
       \setminus S \land \varphi(e)=\{v,v'\} \bigr\}, \] \ie $E(S)$ is
       the set of edges which connect to one vertex (one endpoint) in
       $S$ and the other in $V\setminus S$.  

     - Note: $E(S)=E(V\setminus S)$.
*** Degree of a vertex
**** Degree of a vertex 				       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     - The *degree* of a vertex $v\in V$ is the number of edges
       connected to $v$ counting the loops twice \ie \[ \deg(v) =
       \lvert \{ e \in E : v \in \varphi(e) \} \rvert + \lvert \{e \in
       E : \varphi(e) = \{v\} \} \rvert \] or \[ \deg(v) = \lvert
       S(\{v\}) \rvert + 2\cdot \lvert \{e\in E : \varphi(e) = \{v\}
       \}\rvert. \]
     - Sometimes the notations $d(v)$ or $\delta(v)$ is used.
*** Regular and \(n\)-regular graphs
**** Regular, and \(n\)-regular graphs 			       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
    - A graph is *\(n\)-regular* (for $n\in\N$) if $\deg(v)=n$ for
      each $v\in V$.
    - A graph is *regular* if $\exists n\in\N$ for which it is
      \(n\)-regular.
**** Equivalent definition of isolated vertices			  :B_example:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: example
     :END:
     A vertex $v\in V$ is isolated $\iff$ $\deg(v)=0$.
*** Connection between the number of edges and the sum of degrees
**** Connection between the number of edges and the sum of degrees :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     If $G=(\varphi,E,V)$ is a finite graph, then $\sum_{v\in
     V}\deg(v) = 2 \lvert E \rvert$
**** Proof 							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     starting from an empty graph, the introduction of each new
     edge increases the sum by $2$, ergo there is an even number of
     vertices with odd degrees.

       - $\varphi(e_3)=\{v_1,v_4\}$
       - $\varphi(e_4)=\{v_3,v_4\}$
       - $\varphi(e_5)=\{v_4\}$
     - $e_1$ and $e_2$ are parallel
     - $e_5$ is a loop
     - $v_5$ is isolated
       - $\deg(v_1)=3$
       - $\deg(v_2)=2$
       - $\deg(v_3)=1$
       - $\deg(v_4)=4$
       - $\deg(v_5)=0$
** Isomorphic graphs
*** Isomorphism
**** Isomorphism of graphs				       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     The graphs $G=(\varphi,E,V)$ and $G'=(\varphi',E',V')$ are
     *isomorphic* if 
     - $\exists f\colon V\to V'$ bijection,
     - $\exists g\colon E\to E'$ bijection and
     - $\forall e \in E$ and $\forall v \in V$ if $v'=f(v)$ and
       $e'=g(e)$ then \[v \in \varphi(e) \iff v' \in \varphi'(e'),\]
       \ie the $(f,g)$ pair of maps "preserves" the connection
       relation.
*** Why is isomorphism important?
**** The isomorphism of graphs is very important!
     - Ironically, we rarely use it explicitly. 
     - Because the /focus of interest/ is the connection relation
       between the edges and vertices, \ie dots connected with lines.
     - If we ignore the (names of) the edges and vertices, we can
       study all the graphs isomorphic to each other.  
     - Isomorphism is used throughout the study of graphs, whenever
       $E$ and $V$ are not defined explicitly.
     - It is because of isomorphism, that we can study graphs
       abstractly, without going into unnecessary detail.
     - *Oh, and you need to know it for the exam!!!*
*** Some well known graphs
**** Complete graph, cycle, path, star 			       :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
     - A *complete graphs* (or a cliques) are a simple graphs with an
       edge between each pair of vertices. The complete graph with $n$
       vertices is $K_n$.
     - The *cycles* with $n$ vertices is the graph with $n$ vertices
       on a circle with vertex is connected to its neighbor. This is $C_n$.
     - If we delete one edge from $C_{n+1}$ then we obtain the $n$
       long *path* denoted by $P_n$, \ie $n$ edges connecting $n+1$
       vertices forming a single line.
     - A *star* is the graph with $n$ vertices on a circle, each
       connected to the vertex in the center.  The star with $n+1$
       vertices is $S_n$.
     - The *hyper\-cubes* $H_n$ (described later) with $n$ vertices
       are also isomorphic to each other.

     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_col: 0.50
     :BEAMER_env: example
     :END:
     - Because the graphs $K_n$, $C_n$, $P_n$, $S_n$ are actually
       classes (sets) of graphs, we do not specify the edges or the
       vertices.
     - Any graph isomorphic to \eg $K_4$ as seen on the picture is
       also a $K_4$ graph.
*** Bipartite graphs
**** Bipartite graph					 :B_definition:BMCOL:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :BEAMER_col: 0.6
     :END:
      A $G=(\varphi,E,V)$ graph is a bipartite graph, if $\exists V',
      V'' \subseteq V$ so that
      - $V' \cap V'' = \emptyset$,
      - $V' \cup V'' = V$ and
      - for every edge $e\in E$, $\varphi(e) \cap V' \neq \emptyset$
        and $\varphi(e) \cap V'' \neq \emptyset$
      \ie the set of vertices $V$ of a *bipartite graph* can be split
      into two non-empty, disjoint sets so that $V'\cup V''=V$, and
      each edge has one endpoint in $V'$ and the other in $V''$.

*** Cartesian product of graphs
**** Cartesian product					       :B_definition:

     Let $G_i=(\varphi_i,E_i,V_i)$ (for $i\in I$ \eg
     $I=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$) be an indexed family of graphs.  The
     *Cartesian product* of these graphs is the graph
     $G=(\varphi,E,V)$, where $V=V_1 \times V_2 \times \cdots$ and two
     vertices are connected if and only if they differ in one
     component only, and if the index of the differing component is
     $j$ then the components are connected in $G_j$ or alternatively
     - $V=\times_{i\in I} V_i=\{(v_1,v_2,\ldots) : v_1 \in V_1 \land
       v_2 \in V_2 \land \cdots \}$,
     - $\varphi(e)=\{v,v'\}$ (for $v=(v_1,v_2,\ldots)$,
       $v'=(v_1',v_2',\ldots)$) if and only if $\exists ! j\in I$ so
       that $\exists e_j \in E_j$ and $\varphi_j(e_j)=\{v_j,v'_j\}$
*** The hyper\-cube
**** The hyper\-cube 						  :B_example:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: example
     :END:
     - The 0-dimensional hyper\-cube $H_0$ consists of one vertex. 
     - The 1-dimensional hyper\-cube $H_1$ consists of two vertices
       connected with a single edge.  
     - For $n>1$, the \(n\)-dimensional hyper\-cube is obtained from the
       Cartesian product of $n$ number of $H_1$ hyper\-cubes, \ie
       \[ H_n = H_{n-1} \times H_1.\]
     An equivalent definition of $H_n$ is: 
     - $V$ contains $n$ long strings of \(0\)'s and \(1\)'s, and there
       is an edge between two vertices if they differ only in one
       element.
** Sub\-graphs
*** Sub\-graphs
**** Sub\-graph 					       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:      
     $G'=(\varphi',E',V')$ is a *sub\-graph* of $G=(\varphi,E,V)$ (or
     $G$ is a *super\-graph* of $G'$) if $G'$ is a graph and
     $E'\subseteq E$, $V'\subseteq V$ and $\varphi' \subseteq \varphi$.
**** Induced sub\-graph					       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Let $G'=(\varphi',E',V')$ be a sub\-graph of $G=(\varphi,E,V)$.
     $G'$ is a *saturated (or full) sub\-graph induced by $V'$* if
     $E'$ contains all the edges of $G$ with both endpoints in $V'$
     ($G'$ is the largest sub\-graph with edges connected to $V'$) \ie
     \[ e\in E \land \varphi(e) \subseteq V' \iff e \in E' \land
     \varphi'(e)=\varphi(e). \]
*** Complement graph
**** Complement graph					       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition

     - The *complement graph of $G'$ with regards to $G$* is the graph
       $(\varphi|_{E\setminus E'},E\setminus E',V)$. 
     - If $G$ is a simple graph with $n$ vertices, then the
       *complement of $G$* is the complement of $G$ with regards to
       $K_n$, \ie the complement of a simple graph is the graph with
       the same vertices and the edges missing from the original
       graph.
       
     In the example below we have a simple graph, its complement, and

*** Deleting edges end vertices

     Let $G=(\varphi,E,V)$ be a graph.  If $E'\subseteq E$, the
     sub\-graph $G'=(\varphi|_{E\setminus E'},E\setminus E',V)$ is
     obtained by *deleting the set of edges $E'$*.
**** Deleting vertices 					       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Let $G=(\varphi,E,V)$ be a graph.  If $V'\subseteq V$, then
     $G'=(\varphi|_{E\setminus E'},E',V')$ is the sub\-graph obtained
     by *deleting the set of vertices $V'$*, where $E'=\{e\in E :
     \varphi(e) \cap V' \neq \emptyset\}$ \ie the subset of edges
     which have either endpoint in $V'$.

     are deleted as well.

     Let $G=(\varphi,E,V)$ be a graph.  
     - If all the vertices $v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_n$ are different in a
       walk, it is called a *route* or a *path*.  
     - An /at least 1 long/ closed trail is a *cycle* (or *circle*) if
       all the vertices in the trail are different with the exception
       of the beginning and the end.
*** Distance, diameter
**** Distance						       :B_definition:

     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     The *distance* between two vertices $v$ and $v'$ is the shortest
     (minimum) length of the walks between them (if there exists a
     walk between them, otherwise it is $+\infty$).
**** Diameter						       :B_definition:

     The *diameter* of a graph is the supremum (least upper bound) of
     the distances between all the vertices in the graph.  (For a
     finite graph, you can use simply the maximum of the lengths).
*** Remarks
**** Paths $\subsetneq$ open trails $\subsetneq$ open walks
     - Every path is an open trail, but there are open trails which
       are not paths.
     - Every open trail is an open walk, but there are open walks
       which are not open trails.
**** Cycle $\subsetneq$ closed trails $\subsetneq$ closed walks
     - Every cycle is a closed trail, but there are closed trails
       which are not cycles.

     With the previous notation, for each graph $G$, for each walk

     obtained in $G$ by deleting the adequate $e_i$, $v_i$ pairs.

     - Otherwise there is at least one vertex recurring on the trail.
       At this vertex the trail can be split into two (shorter) closed
       trails. 
     - By repeating this procedure on the two closed sub\-trails, we
       obtain shorter and shorter closed trail, until we are left with
       only cycles.

     - A graph is *connected* if there exists a walk (or equivalently a path) between any two

     - The relation on $V$ defined on two vertices if and only if they
       are connected via a walk (or path) is an equivalence relation
       (reflexive, transitive and symmetrical).  The sub\-graphs
       spanned by the classes generated by this equivalence relation
       are the *components* of the original graph.
*** Remarks about connectedness
**** Remark about edges and components
     - Two vertices from different components can not be adjacent so
       each edge belongs to only one component.  
**** Equivalent definition of a connected graph

     The following statements are equivalent for the simple graph $G$:
     1) $G$ is a tree (\ie connected and without cycles);
     2) $G$ is connected, but deleting an edge makes it disconnected;
     3) if $v$ and $v'$ are different vertices of $G$, then there
	exists exactly one path between $v$ and $v'$;
     4) $G$ does not contain any cycle, but the graph obtained by
	adding an edge between two of its vertices has a cycle.
*** Proof
**** Proof of $1 \iff 2 \iff 3$ 				    :B_proof:

     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     - $1\Rightarrow 2$: If the edge between $v$ and $v'$ is deleted,
       and the graph is connected, then there is a path between $v$
       and $v'$ in the sub\-graph, so returning that edge would
       introduce a cycle.
     - $2\Rightarrow3$: If there were two different paths between $v$
       and $v'$: $v=v_0,v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n=v'$ and
       $v=v_0',v_1',v_2',\ldots,v_m' = v'$.  Let $k=\min\{i : v_i\neq
       v_i'\}$.  Deleting the edge between $v_{k-1}$ and $v_k$ would
       leave the graph connected, because in all walks, that edge can
       be replaced with the walk \[ v_{k-1}, v_k', v_{k+1}', \ldots,
       v_m' = v' = v_n, v_{n-1} \ldots, v_{k+1}, v_k.\]
     - $3\Rightarrow 1$: If there is a cycle $v,v',\ldots,v$ in the
       graph, then there are two paths from $v$ to $v'$.
*** Proof
**** Proof of $1\iff 4$ 					    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     - $1\Rightarrow 4$: A tree has no cycles and adding a loop, adds
       a cycle. Adding a new edge with endpoints $v\neq v'$ and
       combining this edge with the path from $v$ to $v'$ again
       introduces a cycle.
     - $4\Rightarrow1$: Add a temporary edge to the graph with
       endpoints $v$ and $v'$.  The temporary edge is part of a cycle.
       So deleting the temporary edge from the cycle leaves us with a
       path from $v$ to $v'$ in the original graph. Since this is true
       for each vertex pair $v$, $v'$, the graph is connected.

     then there is a vertex $w$ connected to $v$.
     - If $w$ is not on the path, the path is not of maximal
       length.
     - If $w$ is on the path, the graph would contain a cycle.
*** Number of edges in a tree

     The following statements are equivalent for the simple finite
     graph $G$ with $n$ vertices:
     1) $G$ is a tree;
     2) $G$ has no cycles and has $n-1$ edges;
     3) $G$ is connected and has $n-1$ edges.
*** Proof (part 1)
**** Proof of $1 \Rightarrow 2$ 				    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     - We need to show for acyclic graphs, that connectedness implies
       $n-1$ edges. 
     - For $n=1$ it is trivial, we proceed with induction on $n$.
     - Suppose the statement is true for all graphs with less then $n$
       vertices, and let $G$ be a tree with $n$ vertices and $v_n$ a
       vertex with only one adjacent vertex $v_{n-1}$ (by the previous
       theorem there has to be such $v_n$ vertex). Deleting $v_n$
       reduces the number of edges and vertices by one. The remaining
       graph is also a tree (acyclic and connected), because $v_n$ is
       an endpoint of some path. The induction hypothesis is true for
       the smaller graph, so it will be true for the original graph.

     - We need to show for a graph with $n-1$ edges, that if it has no
       cycles, then it is connected.
     - Using the same reasoning and same notation as in the previous
       part of the proof, deleting $v_n$ is connected to $v_{n-1}$,
       and by induction $v_{n-1}$ is connected with the rest of the
       graph.
*** Proof (part 3)
**** Proof of $3 \Rightarrow 1$ 				    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     - We need to show for a connected graph, that if it has $n-1$
       edges, it has no cycles.
     - If $G$ would have a cycle, then deleting any edge from the
       cycle would leave us with a connected graph.  Continue deleting
       the edges until no cycles are left but leaving the graph
       connected, \ie until a tree is obtained.  If we deleted $k$
       edges, than we obtain a tree with $n$ vertices and $n-k-1$
       edges.  But since we proved that 1 implies 2, only $k=0$ is
       possible.
*** Spanning tree

**** Existence of Spanning trees 				  :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     Every connected (finite) graph has a spanning tree.
**** Proof
     - Keep deleting edges of cycles while there are cycles, while the
       graph remains connected.
     - After a finite number of steps, the process stops: the
       remaining graph has no cycles and it is connected.
*** Number of cycles
**** Number of cycles 						  :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     A finite connected graph $G=(\varphi, E, V)$ contains at least
     $\lvert E \rvert-\lvert V \rvert+1$ cycles with different sets of edges.
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     1. Let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$.  It has $\lvert V \rvert-1$
	edges.
     2. Let $E'$ be the set of edges of $G$ which are not in $T$.
     3. If $e\in E'$, then adding this edge to $T$ introduces a cycle
	$C_e$.
     4. Of course, $C_e$ is part of the original graph.
     5. The edge $e$ is on the cycle $C_e$, but if $e\neq e'\in E'$,
	then $e$ is not in $C_{e'}$, so the sets of edges of each
	cycle $C_e$ for each $e\in E'$ are mutually different.
*** Remarks
    - The set of edges of each cycle $C_e$ is uniquely defined by
      each $e\in E'$, because if adding an edge to the spanning tree
      $T$ would yield two different cycles, that would mean that
      there were two different paths between the end points off the
      added edge in $T$, so $T$ wouldn't be a tree.  
    - This system of cycles is the *basic cycle system* determined
      by the spanning tree $T$.
    - There might be other cycles in the graph, but it can be shown
      that all cycles can be systematically expressed using the basic
      cycle system.
    - The boundary given in the theorem is only a lower bound, \eg the
      graph defined by the edges of a tetrahedron has more than
      $\lvert E \rvert-\lvert V \rvert-1$ edges.

     - If $E'\subseteq E$ a separates $G$ and edges has no trivial
       subset which also separates $G$, then $E'$ is a *separating

**** Remark
     If $E'$ separates $G$, then deleting the $E'$ from $G$ will

     1. If we remove an edge $e\in E'$ from $T$ it will be separated
	into two components: $T_1$ and $T_2$.
     2. $\lvert E'\rvert = \lvert V \rvert-1$ and for each edge $e\in
        E'$ the set $E_e=(E\setminus E')\cup\{e\}$ separates $G$ so it
        contains at least one separating set.  $E_e$ separates $G$
        because all the paths from $T_1$ to $T_2$ either go through
        $e$ or one of the edges in $E\setminus E'$.
     3. Let this separating set be $S_e$, so that $e\in S_e$ and
        $S_e\subseteq E_e$, then for each $e\in E'$ the separating
        sets $S_e$ are different.  Moreover, $E_e$ contains exactly

     For $s=0$ \ie $\forall d(v)$ even, the proof is constructive:
     Start with a single vertex $v\in V$, which is a closed trail with
     no edges.  Extend this closed trail into a longer closed trail,
     until all edges are used up as follows:
     1. If there is an unused edge, there is a vertex $v'$ connected
        to it.
     2. Start a trail from $v'$ always choosing unused edges.
     3. Because all vertices are connected to an even number of unused
        edges, the procedure/algorithm can only stops at $v'$.
     4. The previous closed trail is extended with the previously

     A *Hamiltonian cycle* (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a cycle which
     contains all vertices of the graph.  A graph is a *Hamiltonian
     graph* if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
*** Ore's theorem
**** Ore's theorem 						  :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     Let $G$ be a (finite and simple) graph with $n\ge 3$ vertices.
     If $\deg(v) + \deg(w) \ge n$ for every pair of non-adjacent
     vertices $v$ and $w$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian.
*** Proof (part 1)
**** Proof of Ore's theorem							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     Indirect proof: if a graph is not Hamiltonian, then $\deg(v) +
     \deg(w) < n$ for at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices $v$
     and $w$.
     1. For each $G$ graph which is non-Hamiltonian, there is a
	non-Hamiltonian graph $H$ which is a super\-graph of $G$, but
	adding any edge to $H$ would introduce a Hamiltonian cycle.
     2. Let $x$ and $y$ be any two non-adjacent vertices in $H$.
     3. Adding the edge between $x$ and $y$ introduces a Hamiltonian cycle, ergo
	there is a Hamiltonian path $x=v_1,v_1,\ldots,v_n=y$. 
*** Proof (part 2)
**** Proof of Ore's theorem
     5. [@4] For each index $i$ in the range $2 \le i \le n$, consider the two
	possible edges in $H$ from $v_1$ to $v_i$ and from $v_{i-1}$ to
	$v_n$.
     6. At most one of these two edges can be present in $H$,
	otherwise the cycle $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{i-1}, v_n,
	v_{n-1}. \ldots, v_i$ would be a Hamiltonian cycle.
     7. The total number of edges connected to either $v_1$ or $v_n$ is
	at most equal to the number of choices of $i$, which is $n-1$.
     8. So in $H$, $\deg(v) + \deg(w)<n$.
     9. The degree of vertices in $G$ are at most equal to the degrees
	in $H$, so $\deg(v) + \deg(w)<n$ is also true in $G$.
*** Consequence of Ore's theorem
**** Dirac's theorem 						  :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     If a finite simple graph $G$ with $n\ge 3$ vertices has
     $\deg(v)\ge n/2$ for all vertices $v$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian.
**** Proof 							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     Because $\deg(v)\ge n/2$ for all vertices, $\deg(v)+\deg(w)\ge
     n/2 + n/2=n$, therefore by Ore's theorem, $G$ is Hamiltonian.  
** Labeling of graphs
*** Labeled and weighted graphs
**** Labeled and weighted graphs 			       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     - In practice, edges and/or vertices hold additional data.
     - If $G=(\varphi, E, V)$ is a graph, $L_e$ and $L_v$ are the sets
       of labels (for edges and vertices respectively), furthermore
       the labeling maps of edges and vertices are $\ell_e\colon E \to
       L_e$ and $\ell_v \colon V \to L_v$, then $(\varphi, E, V,
       \ell_e, L_e, \ell_v, L_v)$ is *labeled graph*.
     - Sometimes only the edges or only the vertices are labeled, then
       the adequate elements are omitted.
     - Sometimes the word *coloring* is used instead of labeling, and
       the labels are colors.
*** Weighted graphs
**** Weighted graphs
     Often $L_e=\R$ or $L_v=\R$, and in this case the term *weighted
     graph* is used and the weight map $w$ connects the elements of
     the graph to their *weights*.  In a $(\varphi, E, V, w)$ graph
     with weighted edges, the weight of $E' \subseteq E$ is
     \[ w(E')=\sum_{e\in E'}w(e), \] and in a graph with weighted
     vertices, the weight of $V' \subseteq V$ is \[w(V')=\sum_{v\in
     V'}w(v).\]

     The following algorithm finds a spanning forest of $G$ with
     minimal weight.
     1. Initialize: $E'\gets \emptyset$.
     2. Terminate?: If $E'\cup \{e\}$ contains a cycle for each edge
        $e\in E\setminus E'$, then the edges in $E'$ are the edges of
        a minimal weight spanning forest.
     3. Expand $E'$: Let $e\in E\setminus E'$ an unused edge with
        minimal weight \ie an edge with $w(e)=\min\{w(e'):e'\in
        E\setminus E'\}$ and set $E'\gets E'\cup\{e\}$. Go to step 2.

     It is enough to restrict the proof to one component only.  
     1. It is clear, that the result will be a spanning tree $T$.
     2. Suppose a $T'$ spanning tree with minimal weight, which has the
	most possible common edges with $T$, and with smaller weight
	than $T$ (then $T$ is not a spanning tree with minimal weight).
     3. Let $e'$ be an edge of $T'$ which is not an edge of $T$.
     4. If $e'$ is added to $T$ than this will add exactly one $C$
	cycle.
     5. For all $e$ edges of the $C$ cycle, it is true that $w(e)\le
	w(e')$, because if $w(e)>w(e')$ then the algorithm would have
	chosen $e'$ instead of $e$.
     6. If we omit $e'$ from $T'$, then it will not be connected, it
	will separate into two components.

     7. [@7] There has to be one more edge $e''$ on the cycle $C$
        which connects the two components ($e''$ is obviously not from
        $T'$), and if we swap $e'$ for $e''$ in $T'$ we get another
        tree $T''$.
     8. We have shown that $w(e'')\le w(e')$.
     9. If $w(e'')<w(e')$, than the weight of $T''$ would be strictly
	less than the weight of $T'$, and that would imply that $T'$ is
	not a spanning tree of minimal weight, which leads to a
	contradiction.
     10. On the other hand, $w(e'')=w(e')$ would imply that $T''$ has
	 more common edges with $T$ than $T'$, which is again a

* Directed graphs
** Basic definitions
*** Directed graph
    # You can imagine directed graphs as a set of dots connected with
    # arrows.
**** Directed graph					       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     A *directed graph* $G=(\psi, E, V)$ is a triplet with $E$ as the
     set of edges, $V$ as the set of vertices, and $\psi\colon E \to
     V\times V$.  If $\psi(e)=(v,v')$, then $v$ is the *tail endpoint*
     and $v'$ is the *head endpoint* of the edge $e$.
**** Remarks
     - Some authors, define $E\subseteq V\times V$, or a bit
       inaccurately, omit the connection map and use the $G=(E,V)$
       notation.
     - For every directed graph $G=(\psi, E, V)$ there is a
       *corresponding undirected graph* $G'=(\varphi, E, V)$ which can
       be obtained by ``forgetting'' the direction, \ie if $\psi(e) =
       (v,v')$ then $\varphi=\{v,v'\}$.
       It is also said that $G$ is an *orientation* of $G'$.  One
       graph usually has multiple orientations.
*** Other definitions
    Most of the definitions, \eg labels, weights \etc, from undirected
    graphs can be extended onto directed graphs by considering the
    corresponding undirected graph.
**** Transpose, strictly parallel 			       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     - The *transpose* of the graph $G=(\psi, E, V)$ is $G'=(\psi', E,
       V)$ for which $\psi(e)=(v,v')$ if and only if
       $\psi'(e)=(v',v)$.  (Of course, the reversed loop is equal to
       itself.)
     - The edges $e_1\neq e_2$, are *strictly parallel* if
       $\psi(e_1)=\psi(e_2)$.

     :END:
     - Let $S\subseteq V$, then $E^+(S)$ the set of edges with tail
       endpoints in $S$ and head endpoints in $V\setminus S$, or
       $E^+(S)=\{e\in E : \exists v \exists v' ( v\in S \land v'\in V
       \setminus S \land (v,v')=\psi(e)) \}$
     - $E^-(S)$ is the set of edges with tail endpoints in $V\setminus
       S$ and head endpoints in $S$ or $E^-(S)=\{e\in E : \exists v
       \exists v' ( v\in S \land v'\in V \setminus S \land
       (v',v)=\psi(e)) \}$
     - $E(S) = E^+(S)\cup E^-(S)$ and $E^+(S)=E^-(V \setminus S)$.
*** Degrees of vertices
**** Out\-degree and in\-degree, sink and source	       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     - The *out\-degree* of the vertex $v\in V$ is
       $d^+(v)=\lvert \{e\in E : \exists v' (v'\in V \land
       (v,v')=\psi(e) )\} \rvert$ (sometimes $\deg^+(v)$ or $\delta^+(v)$),
       \ie the number of edges with tail endpoint $v$.  If $d^+(v)=0$
       then $v$ is a *sink*.
     - The *in\-degree* of the vertex $v\in V$ is $d^-(v)=\lvert \{e\in
       E : \exists v' (v'\in V \land (v',v)=\psi(e) )\} \rvert$ (sometimes
       $\deg^-(v)$ or $\delta^-(v)$), \ie the number of edges with
       head endpoint $v$.  If $d^-(v)=0$ then $v$ is a *source*.
*** Degrees and edges
**** The connection between the sum of degrees and number of edges :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:

     :END:
     - In a finite directed graph, \[ \sum_{v\in V}d^+(v) = \sum_{v\in
       V}d^-(v) = \lvert E \rvert \] since each edge increases both
       sums by one (by introducing one tail and one head endpoint).
** Isomorphic graphs

     The graphs $G=(\psi, E, V)$ and $G'=(\psi', E', V')$ are
     *isomorphic* if $\exists f\colon E \to E'$ bijection and $\exists
     g\colon V\to V'$ bijection, so $\forall e\in E$ $\psi(e)=(v,v')
     \iff \psi(f(e))=(g(v),g(v'))$ \ie the $(f,g)$ pair preserves the
     ``tail'' and ``head endpoint'' relations.
**** Some special graphs 					  :B_example:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: example
     :END:
     Again we can talk about a class (or set) of graphs as one graph,
     \eg $\vec{C}_n$ is the directed cycle of $n$ vertices,
     $\vec{P}_n$ is the $n$ long directed path, $\vec{S}_n$ is the
     directed star, with $n$ vertices with zero in\-degrees and one
     out\-degrees and one vertex with $n$ in\-degrees and zero
     out\-degrees, $\vec{K}_n$ is the directed complete graph.

** Representation of graphs
*** List representation
**** List representation
     A directed graphs can be represented with an array of lists.
     - After enumerating the vertices, each entry in the array is a
       list of $(n,n')$ pairs, where $n$ is the number of $v$ and
       $n'$ the number of $v'$.
     - Additional information van be stored with the list entries.
     - For undirected graphs, each edge is stored two times, once for
       each endpoint.
*** Matrix representation
    An $m \times n$ matrix is a table of $m$ rows and $n$ columns, and
    the \(i\)-th row and \(j\)-th column is $a_{i,j}$ ($1 \le i \le m$ and
    $1 \le j \le n$).  

    Let $G=(\psi,E,V)$ be a directed graph, $E=\{e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_m\}$,
    $V=\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n\}$.
*** Matrix representation
**** Incidence matrix
     - The *incidence matrix* of $G$ is an $n \times m$ matrix, where $1
       \le i \le n$, $1 \le j \le m$ and $a_{i,j}=1$ if $v_i$ is a tail
       endpoint of $e_j$ and $a_{i,j}=-1$ if $v_i$ is a head endpoint of
       $e_j$.
     - If $G$ is undirected, then the elements of the matrix are
       $\lvert a_{i,j} \rvert$.
**** Adjacency matrix
     - The *adjacency matrix* for $G$ is an $n \times n$ matrix where
       $1 \le i,j \le n$ and $a_{i,j}$ is the number of edges from
       $v_i$ to $v_j$.
     - If $G$ is undirected, $a_{i,i}$ is the number of loop edges
       connected to $v_i$ and $a_{i,j}$ is the number of edges
       connecting $v_i$ and $v_j$.
** Sub\-graphs
*** Sub\-graphs
**** Directed sub\-graphs				       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     - The graph $G'=(\psi', E', V')$ is a *directed sub\-graph* of
       $G=(\psi, E, V)$ if $E'\subseteq E$, $V' \subseteq V$ and
       $\psi'\subseteq \psi$.  It also said that $G$ is a *directed
       super\-graph* of $G'$.
     - If $E'$ contains all edges with both tail and head endpoints in
       $V'$, then $G'$ is a *saturated* sub\-graph induced by $V'$.
     - If $G'=(\psi, E', V')$ is a directed sub\-graph of $G=(\psi, E,
       V)$, then the *complement* of $G'$ with respect to $G$ is the
       graph $(\psi\vert_{E\setminus E'}, E\setminus E', V)$.  If $G$
       is not explicitly stated, then it is understood to be the
       complement with respect to the complete graph.
*** Deleting edges and vertices
**** Deleting edges and vertices from graphs 		       :B_definition:

       set of edges $E'$ is $G'=(\psi\vert_{E\setminus E'}, E\setminus
       E', V)$.
     - If $V'\subseteq V$, then let $E'=\{e\in E : \exists v \exists v'
       (\psi(e)=(v,v') \lor \psi(e)=(v',v)) \land v\in V'\}$ then the
       sub\-graph obtained by deleting the set of vertices $V'$ is

*** Walks, trails, paths 
**** Directed walks, trails, paths and cycles		       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Let $G=(\psi, E, V)$ be a directed graph.

       finite sequence $v_0,e_1,v_1,e_2,v_2,\ldots,v_{n-1},e_n,v_n$,
       where the $\psi(e_i)=(v_{i-1},v_i)$ for each $1\le i \le n$
       with $v_0=v$ and $v_n=v'$.  If $v=v'$ then it is a *closed
       directed walk*, otherwise it is an *open directed walk*.
     - If all the edges differ in a directed walk, then it is a
       *directed trail*.  If the directed walk is closed, then it is a
       *closed directed trail*, otherwise it is an *open directed
       trail*.
     - A directed walk is a *directed path* if all the
       $v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_n$ vertices are different.  A directed trail
       of at least one length is a *directed cycle*, if all the
       vertices are different except the first and the last one.
*** Strong connectivity    
**** Strong connectivity				       :B_definition:

     - A directed graph is *strongly connected* if between any pair of
       vertices $(v,v')$ there is a directed path from $v$ to $v'$
       (and as a consequence, there has to be also a directed path
       from $v'$ to $v$).
     - On the vertices of a given directed graph, the relation that
       there is a directed path from one vertex to another and from
       the other one to the first, is an equivalence relation,
       therefore it defines a classification of the vertices.
     - A directed sub\-graph induced by the vertices in one such class
       is a *strong component* of the directed graph.
     - A graph is strongly connected if and only if all of it's
       vertices belong to one class, \ie it has only one strong
       component.
*** Example
    Unlike with undirected graphs, not all edges belong to a
    component.

       other vertices with in\-degree 1. (A directed tree can be
       defined as the traverse of the above defined graph.)

       root.  The length of this path is the *depth* of the vertex.
     - The maximum of the depths of vertices is the *height* the tree.
     - If there is an edge with $v$ as its tail endpoint and $v'$ as
       its head endpoint, then $v$ is the *parent* of $v'$ and $v'$ is
       a *child* of $v$, If two vertices have the same parent then

       - There exists exactly one orientation of that tree which is a
	 directed tree with the same root vertex as the designated one:
	 each vertex is the head endpoint of the last edge of the one
	 path from the designated root vertex to the mentioned vertex
	 (which will be the tail endpoint for all the other edges).

       from the same vertex have different labels.
     - The most notable case is $q=2$ \ie the *binary tree*: here
       *left edge*, or *left child* and *right edge* or *right child*
       are used instead of labels $0$ and $1$.
       - We remark, that if two \(q\)-ary trees differ only in the labels,
	 they are still considered not equal, \eg in a binary tree with
	 only one edge, it's important if it's a left or a right edge.
     - Directed trees are usually drawn with the root at the top.
       [fn::This isn't consistent with the name ``tree'', but it's
       consistent with the way we think about them, a parent is above
       the children etc.]

     Let $(\psi, E, V, w)$ be a directed weighted graph with $w(e)>0$
     for each $e\in E$, $s\in V$ and $T\subseteq V$.
     The following algorithm calculates $d(v)=$ the minimal weight of
     directed paths from $s$ to $v$, for each $v\in T$ (or $+\infty$
     if there is no path).
     1. Initialization: $S\gets \emptyset$ ($S$ is the set of
        ``finished'' vertices), $H\gets \{s\}$, $H$ is the set of
        vertices ``being processed'') and $d(s)\gets 0$; $v\in
        V\setminus \{s\}$ $d(v)\gets +\infty$.
     2. Terminate?: If $T\subseteq S$ or $H=\emptyset$, then terminate.
     3. Expand $S$: Let $t\in H$ so that $d(t)=\min\{d(t'):t'\in H\}$.
        $S\gets S\cup \{t\}$ and $H\gets H\setminus \{t\}$, and for
        each edge $e$ coming from $t$ to $v\in V\setminus S$, 
	- if $d(t)+w(e)<d(v)$, then $d(v)\gets d(t)+w(e)$ 
	- if $v\not\in H$, then put $v$ into $H$.
     4. Go to 2.
*** Proof of Dijkstra's algorithm
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     - The proof is by induction on the number of elements of $S$, by
       showing that 
       1. for every $t\in S$ the value of $d(t)$ is the minimal weight
          of the directed walks from $s$ to $t$, and
       2. if $v\in H$, then every directed walk from $s$ to $v$, which
          has every vertex in $S$ except $v$, has weight at least
          $d(v)$.
     - After the first initialization step, this is trivially true.
     - Let $t\in H$ (chosen in the third step), and consider an
       arbitrary directed walk with weight $W$ from $s$ to $t$. We
       will show, that $W\ge d(t)$.
*** Proof of Dijkstra's algorithm				:B_fullframe:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: fullframe
    :END:
**** Proof part 2
     - Let $t'$ be the first vertex on the walk which is not in $S$
       and $W'$ the weight of the sub\-walk from $s$ to $t'$.  
     - $W'\le W$, and by the second part of the induction
       hypothesis $W'\ge d(t')$, and because we chose $t$ to have
       minimal value of $d(t)$ we have $d(t)\le d(t')$, so $W\ge d(t)$
       concludes the proof of the first part of our statement.  
     - After updating the value of $d(v)$ in the third step, if a walk
       goes from $s$ to $v$ and its last vertex is not in $S$, then
       let $v'$ be the vertex before the last and $e$ the last edge.
     - Since $v'\in S$ and the weight of the sub-walk from $s$ to $v'$
       is at least $d(v')$, the weight of the entire walk has to be at
       least $d(v')+w(e)$, and when $v'$ is added to $S$ it can be set
       at most to this value, and after it can only decrease.

     - A *planar graph* is a graph that can be embedded in the plane
       ($\R^2$), \ie, it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that
       its edges intersect only at their endpoints. (Drawing a graph can
       be generalized to any metric space, \eg $\R^n$)
     - Obviously, not all graphs can be drawn, \eg it is possible that
       a graph has so many vertices that there is no injective map
       $f\colon V\to X$.  That is why we are only considering finite
       graphs.
     - The statements about drawing graphs are only about simple
       graphs, but they can easily be extended to non-simple graphs as
       well.
     - We are concerned only about drawing graphs in the plane, sphere
       and in the (three dimensional) space.

       vertex $v$, and the sub\-graph induced by the rest of the
       vertices can be drawn in $\R^3$.
     - Each three of the images of these vertices in $\R^3$ defines a
       plane.  Choose the image of $v$ so that it is not on any of
       these planes.  Let the images of edges connected to $v$ be
