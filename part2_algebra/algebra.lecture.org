* Groups
** Definitions and examples
*** Reminder
**** Groupoid                                                 :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     $(G,\cdot)$ is a *groupoid* (or *magma*) if $G$ is a set and
     $\cdot : G \times G \to G$ is a binary operation \ie $\forall
     a,b\in G \exists c \in G$ so that $c = a\cdot b$.  This property
     is called /closure/ under the operation $\cdot$.
**** Semigroup						       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     $(G,\cdot)$ is a *semigroup* if it is a groupoid and the
     operation is /associative/ \ie $\forall a,b,c \in G : a\cdot
     (b\cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$.
*** Reminder
**** Monoid						       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     $(G,\cdot)$ is a *monoid* if it is a semigroup and it has an
     /neutral element/ (sometimes referred to as the /identity
     element/, or /zero element/) \ie $\forall g\in G$ $\exists e \in
     G$ so that $e\cdot g=g=g\cdot e$.
**** Group                                                     :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     A monoid $(G,\cdot)$ with the identity element $e$ is a *group*
     if $\forall g \in G \exists g^{-1} \in G$ so that $g \cdot g^{-1}
     = g^{-1} \cdot g = e$.
**** Abelian group					       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     A group is an *Abelian group* if the operation is /commutative/
     \ie for every $a,b \in G$ $a$ and $b$ /commute/: $a\cdot b = b
     \cdot a$.
*** More detailed identity
**** Left and right identities                                 :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Let $(G,\ast)$ be a groupoid.
     - If $\exists e_L \in G$ such that $\forall g \in G : e_L \ast g
       = g$, then $e_L$ is a *left identity* (left neutral element).
     - If $\exists e_R \in G$ so that $\forall g \in G : g \ast e_R =
       g$, then $e_R$ is a *right identity* (right neutral element).
     - If $e$ is both a left and right identity, then $e$ is an
       identity.
**** The identities are unique                                    :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     Let $(G,\ast)$ be a groupoid.  If $e_L$ is a left and $e_R$ is a
     right identity in $G$ then $e_L = e_R$.
**** Proof: $e_R = e_L \ast e_R = e_L$.                             :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:

*** More detailed inverse
**** Left and right inverse                                    :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Let $(G,\ast)$ be a monoid with the identity $e$ and $g\in G$.
     - If $\exists g_L \in G$ such that $g_L \ast g = e$ then $g_L$ is
       a *left inverse* of $g$.
     - If $\exists g_R \in G$ such that $g \ast g_R = e$ then $g_R$ is
       a *right inv.* of $g$.
     - If $g'$ is both a left and a right inverse of $g$ then it is
       (simply) the inverse of $g$.
**** The inverse is unique                                        :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     Let $(G,\ast)$ be a monoid with identity $e$ and $g \in G$. If
     $g_L$ is a left and $g_R$ is a right inverse of $g$ then
     $g_L=g_R$.
**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     $g_L = g_L * e = g_L * (g * g_R) = (g_L * g) * g_R = e * g_R =
     g_R$.
*** Homo\-morphisms
**** Structure  preserving maps                               :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Let $(X,\ast)$ and $(Y,\diamond)$ be two groupoids, and
     $\varphi:X\to Y$.  Then the map (\ie function) $\varphi$ is
     *structure preserving* if for each $a,b \in X$: \[ \varphi(a\ast
     b) = \varphi(a) \diamond \varphi(b). \]
     
     $\varphi(X)$ is the *homomorphic image* of $X$ (under $\varphi$).
     $\varphi$ is sometimes called a *homomorphism*.
**** Remark
     For goupoids we usually use the $\cdot$ (dot) operation, and omit
     it if written between operands \ie $ab$ instead of $a \cdot b$.
*** Homo\-morphisms
**** Names of structure preserving maps
     Let $\varphi:G\to G'$ be a *homo\-morphism*:
     - if $\varphi$ is injective it is a *mono\-morphism* ,
     - if $\varphi$ is surjective it is an *epi\-morphism*
     - if $\varphi$ is bijective it is an *iso\-morphism* 
       
     - if $G=G'$ then $\varphi$ is an *endo\-morphism* and
     - if $G=G'$ and $\varphi$ is also bijective it is an
       *auto\-morphism* 
*** Examples
**** Mono\-morphism $x \mapsto 2^x$ 
     Maps $(\R,\cdot)$ to $(\R^+,+)$)
**** Epi\-morphism $n \mapsto \overline{n}$
     Maps $(\Z,+)$ to $(\Z_6,+)$)
**** Iso\-morphism $\overline{b} \mapsto (b \bmod 2 = 1)$
     Maps $(\Z_2,\cdot)$ to $(\{\uparrow,\downarrow\},\land)$
**** Endo\-morphism $\overline{n} \mapsto \overline{2n}$
     Maps $(\Z_{6},+)$ to $(\Z_{6},+$)
**** Auto\-morphism $\overline{m} \mapsto \overline{2m}$
     Maps $(\Z_5,+)$ to $(\Z_{5},+)$)
*** Two theorems
**** Composition of homomorphisms                                 :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     Let $f_1 : X \to Y$ and $f_2 : Y \to Z$ be two homomorphisms.
     Then $f_2 \circ f_1$ is also a homomorphism.
**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     $(f_2 \circ f_1)(ab) = f_2(f_1(ab)) = f_2(f_1(a)f_1(b)) =
     f_2(f_1(a))f_2(f_1(b))$ which is $(f_2 \circ f_1)(a) \cdot
     (f_2\circ f_1)(b)$.
**** Inverse of isomorphisms                                      :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     The inverse of an isomorphism is also an isomorphism.
**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     $f^{-1}(f(a)f(b)) = f^{-1}(f(ab)) = ab = f^{-1}(f(a))
     f^{-1}(f(b))$
*** Homo\-morphic image of a group
**** Statements							  :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a semi\-group and $\varphi:G\to G'$ a
     homo\-morphism. Then the following are true:
     1. $\varphi(G)$ is a semi\-group.
     2. If $e\in G$ is a left identity, right identity or identity,
        then $\varphi(e)$ is a left identity, right identity or
        identity too.
     3. If $g'\in G$ is a left inverse, right inverse or inverse of
        $g\in G$, then $\varphi(g')$ is a left inverse, or right
        inverse or inverse of $\varphi(g)$.
     4. If $g,h \in G$ commute, then commute $\varphi(g)$ and
        $\varphi(h)$ as well.
*** Proof
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     The proof is pretty simple, we just need to use the structure
     preserving property of $\varphi$.  Let $(G,\diamond)$,
     $(G',\ast)$ and $\varphi : G \to G'$.
     \begin{multline*}
     \varphi(a) \ast (\varphi(b) \ast \varphi(c)) 
     = \varphi(a) \ast \varphi (b \diamond c)
     = \varphi(a \diamond (b \diamond c) ) \\
     = \varphi((a \diamond b) \diamond c) = \varphi(a \diamond b) \ast \varphi(c)
     = (\varphi(a) \ast \varphi(b)) \ast \varphi(c)  
     \end{multline*}
     Or for the identity element, $\varphi(e) \ast \varphi(a) =
     \varphi(e \diamond a) = \varphi(a)$. etc.
*** Other ways to define groups
**** Equivalent definitions					  :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a semi\-group, then the following statements
     are equivalent:
     1. $G$ is a group.
     2. $G\neq\emptyset$ and for every $a,b\in G$ there exists a
        *unique* $x,y\in G$ so that $ax=b$ and $ya=b$.
     3. $G\neq\emptyset$ and for every $a,b\in G$ there exists a
        $x,y\in G$ so that $ax=b$ and $ya=b$.
*** Proof
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     $1\Rightarrow 2$ is simple using $x=a^{-1}b$, $y=ba^{-1}$. 
     
     $2\Rightarrow 3$ is trivial.
     
     $3 \Rightarrow 1$ consists of the following 2 parts:
     - There is a right identity in $G$: Let $a\in G$, then $\exists
       e\in G$ so that $ae=a$.  For every $b\in G$ $\exists y\in G$ so
       that $ya=b$.  From this we have $be=yae=ya=b$ \ie $be=b$ for
       each $b\in G$, \ie $e$ is a right identity. Similarly show that
       $eb=b$ for each $b$, \ie $e$ is a left identity, ergo $e$ is
       the identity element \ie $G$ is a monoid.
     - Every element has an inverse: For $e$ and every $a$ there is an
       $x$ such that $ax = e$ and $ya = e$, \ie $x$ is a right inverse
       and $y$ is a left inverse of $a$ \ie $x=a^{-1}$.
*** Simplification rule
**** Simplification rule                                          :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     In groups the operation is *regular*, \ie $ac = bc$ implies $a =
     b$, and $ca = cb$ also implies $a = b$.
**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     $a = a(cc^{-1}) = (ac)c^{-1} \stackrel{\ast}{=} (bc)c^{-1} =
     b(cc^{-1}) = b$, where the equality with the asterisk is implied
     by $ac = bc$.
**** Remark
     Not every structure with a regular operation is a group \eg
     $(N,+)$ is not a group but $a + c = b + c \implies a = b$.
*** Important note
**** Don't forget the prerequisite                :B_example:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: example
     :END:
     Let $(H,\cdot)$ be a groupoid, where $H = \{a,b,c\}$ and the
     $\cdot$ is given in the following table:
     | $\cdot$ | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ |
     |---------+-----+-----+-----|
     | /       | <   |     |     |
     | $a$     | $b$ | $a$ | $c$ |
     | $b$     | $a$ | $c$ | $b$ |
     | $c$     | $c$ | $b$ | $a$ |
     For any $h_1,h_2 \in H$ the equations $h_1 x = h_2$ and $y h_1 =
     h_2$ always have a solution in $H$, but $(H,\cdot)$ is still not
     a group, since there is no identity element, so we cannot define
     an inverse.  The reason for this is that $(H,\cdot)$ is not even
     a semi-group, $\cdot$ is not associative: $(ab)c = ac = c \ne a =
     ab = a(bc)$.
** Subgroups and generated subgroups
*** Subgroups
**** Sub\-groups                                               :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a group and $H\subseteq G$. $H$ is a
     *sub\-group* of $G$ (or $G$ is an *over\-group* of $H$) and write
     $H \le G$ if $(H, \cdot_{\vert_{H \times H}})$ is a group.  $H=G$
     and $H=\{e\}$ are *trivial subgroups*.  All $G\neq H$, $H \le G$
     are *proper subgroups*.
**** Remark
     Note that the $H \le G$ is not entirely accurate, we should write
     $(H,\cdot_{\vert_{H \times H}}) \le (G,\cdot)$, and use the
     $\cdot_{\vert_{H \times H}}$ when talking about calculations in
     $H$, but it is usually clear from the context, and we can use
     simply the dot $\cdot$ operator, or just omit it as before.
**** Sub\-groups                                                  :B_example:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: example
     :END:
     $(2\Z,+) \le (\Z, +)$, $(\Q \setminus \{0\}, \cdot) \le
     (\R\setminus\{0\},\cdot)$, $(E_2,\cdot) \le (E_{4,
     \cdot})$[fn::$E_n = \{z\in\C:z^n=1\}$ \ie \(n\)-th roots of
     unity]
*** Equivalent definitions
**** Equivalent definitions					  :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$, then the following
     are equivalent:
     1. $H \le G$ \ie $H$ is a sub\-group of $G$.
     2. The operation is a $\cdot : H\times H \to H$ function, the
        identity element $e$ of $G$ is also an identity element of $H$
        and $H^{-1}\subseteq H$.
     3. $H\neq\emptyset$, $HH\subseteq H$ and $H^{-1}\subseteq H$.
     4. $H\neq\emptyset$ and $H^{-1}H\subseteq H$.
     Notation: $H^{-1}=\{h^{-1} : h\in H\}$, $HH'=\{hh':h\in H,h'\in
     H'\}$ 
*** Equivalent definitions (proof)
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     - $1\Rightarrow2$: the operation is obviously $\cdot : H\times
       H\to H$.  Let $e'$ be the identity element in $H$ and $e$ the
       identity element in $G$. Then $he'=h=he$ for each $h$.
       Multiplying with $h^{-1}$ we get $e=e'$.  And since $H$ is a
       group, $h\in H$ implies $h^{-1} \in H$ so $H^{-1}\subseteq H$.

     - $2\Rightarrow 3$: $e\in H$ so $H\neq\emptyset$ and $\cdot :
       H\times H\to H$ so $HH\subseteq H$.

     - $3\Rightarrow 4$: $H^{-1}\subseteq H$ so $H^{-1}H \subseteq HH
       \subseteq H$.

     - $4\Rightarrow 1$: $h\in H$ so $e=h^{-1}h \in H^{-1}H \subseteq
       H$.  $h\in H$ (and $e\in H$) so $h^{-1} = h^{-1}e \in H^{-1}H
       \subseteq H$ so every $h\in H$ has an inverse, the inverse in
       $G$.  $(h_1^{-1})^{-1}=h_1$ so if $h_1,h_2\in H$ then
       $h_1h_2=(h_1^{-1})^{-1}h_2 \in H^{-1}H \subseteq H$ has closure
       under the group operation.
*** Remarks and corollary
**** Remarks
     The subsets in 3 and 4 are actually equations, so in 3 $HH\subseteq
     H$, $H^{-1}\subseteq H$ and in 4 $H^{-1}H\subseteq H$ is actually
     $HH=H$, $H^{-1}=H$ and in 4 $H^{-1}H=H$.  
**** Proof
     This is true because, 
     - $H=eH\subseteq HH$, 
     - $h=(h^{-1})^{-1}$ so $H\subseteq H^{-1}$ and
     - $e=e^{-1}$ so $H= eH = e^{-1}H \subseteq H^{-1}H$.
     
     Notation: $gH = \{ gh : h \in H\}$ 
*** Intersection of sub\-groups is a sub\-group
**** Intersection of subgroups 					  :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     $H_i\le G$ for each $i\in I$, then $H=\cap_{i\in I} H_i\le G$ \ie
     the intersection of sub\-groups is also a sub\-group.
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     $H \subseteq H_i$ and $H^{-1}\subseteq H_i^{-1}$, so $H^{-1} H
     \subseteq H_i^{-1} H_i \subseteq H_i$ for each $i\in I$ so
     $H^{-1} H \subseteq H$.
*** Remarks and examples
**** Klein group						  :B_example:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: example
     :END:
     The group with element $G=\{e,a,b,c\}$ with the operation defined
     in the following table is the *Klein group*:
     | $\cdot$ | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ |
     |---------+-----+-----+-----+-----|
     | /       | <   |     |     |     |
     | $e$     | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ |
     | $a$     | $a$ | $e$ | $c$ | $b$ |
     | $b$     | $b$ | $c$ | $e$ | $a$ |
     | $c$     | $c$ | $b$ | $a$ | $e$ |
**** Remark
     The union of subgroups is not always a subgroup.  \Eg $\{e,a\}$
     and $\{e,b\}$ are subgroups of the Klein group (see next slide)
     but $\{e,a,b\}$ is not a subgroup because $ab=c$.
*** Generated subgroup
**** The subgroup generated by a subset			       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a group and $K\subseteq G$.  
     - Then the *subgroup generated by the subset $K$* is \[\langle K
       \rangle=\bigcap\{ H : H\le G \land K \subseteq H\}\] \ie the
       intersection of all subgroups containing $K$ or the
       ``smallest'' subgroup of $G$ containing $K$.
     - If $\langle K \rangle=G$ then $K$ is a *generating set* of
       $G$.
*** Cyclic groups
**** Remark 
    For finitely generated groups we can omit the set braces \ie
    $\langle \{ a, b, c \} \rangle=\langle a,b,c \rangle$.
**** Cyclic group					       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     If $G$ has a generating set of one element then $G$ is a
     *cyclic group*.  The element $g$ generating the group is the
     *generator* of the group \ie if $\exists g \in G$ so that
     $\langle g \rangle = G$ for cyclic groups.
*** Dihedral group
**** Example: dihedral groups
     $D_n$ is the set of transformations of the equilateral $n$ sided
     polygon onto itself \ie transformations leaving it in place.  The
     group operation is function composition (\ie performing the two
     transformations one after the other).

** Cyclic groups
*** Building generated sub\-groups from the generating set
**** Alternative formulation of a generated sub\-group            :B_theorem:

     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     \[\langle K \rangle = \{g_1 g_2 \cdots g_n : n \in \N, g_i \in K
     \cup K^{-1}, 1 \le i \le n \}\] 

     Remarks: The empty product (when $n=0$) equals the identity
     element.  And an obvious observation is that $\langle K \rangle =
     \langle K^{-1} \rangle$.
**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:

     RHS is a subgroup (why?) which contains $K$ (why?) by
     construction, so RHS is a subset of LHS.  LHS is a subset of RHS
     because $\langle K \rangle$ is the "smallest" subgroup which
     is a super\-set of $K$.
*** Generated subgroups of cyclic groups
**** Corollary 							  :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     Let $G$ be a cyclic group and $g\in G$ then $\langle g \rangle =
     \{g^k:k\in\Z\}$.  The homo\-morphic image of a cyclic group is
     also cyclic and the image of the generator is the generator of
     the homo\-morphic image of the group.
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     The first statement follows from the previous theorem and that
     $g^{-k} = (g^{-1})^k$.  Using induction
     $\varphi(g^n)=\varphi(g)^n$ for every $n\in\N$.  $\varphi(h^{-1})
     = \varphi(h)^{-1}$ so $\varphi(g^n)=\varphi(g)^n$ is true for
     every $n\in\Z$, therefore $\varphi(\langle g \rangle) =
     \langle\varphi(g)\rangle$.
*** Order
    Let $(G,\cdot)$ and $g\in G$.
    - The *order of the group* is $\lvert G \rvert$ \ie the number of
      elements of the group if this number is finite, $\infty$
      otherwise.
    - The *order of the element $g$* is $\lvert g \rvert = \min\{
      n\in\N^+ : g^n=e \}$ if such a number exists, $\infty$
      otherwise.  Sometimes, the order of an element is written as
      $o(g)$ or $o_*(g)$ (where $*$ is the group operation).
    Note: $g^n$ is not exponentiation, but $n-1$ "multiplications"
    between $n$ number of $g$'s: $g^n=\underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots
    g}_{n}$ (syntactic sugar).
*** Structure of cyclic groups

     :END:
     Let $(G,\cdot)$ a cyclic group.
     1. If $\lvert G \rvert=\infty$, then $(G,\cdot)$ is isomorphic to
        $(\Z,+)$.
     2. If $\lvert G \rvert=n$, then $(G,\cdot)$ is isomorphic to
        $(\Z_n,+)$.
     Specially: Cyclic groups are commutative.
*** Proof (part 1)
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     Let $g$ be a generator of $G$ \ie $\langle g \rangle=G$ and
     $\varphi(k)=g^k$.  $\varphi:\mathbb{Z} \to G$ is a
     homo\-morphism.
     - $\varphi(\Z)=G$, so $\varphi$ is an epi\-morphism (it is
       surjective, as seen in the previous theorem and because $g$
       generates the entire $G$).  If $\varphi$ is also injective,
       then $\lvert G \rvert = \infty$ and so $\Z$ and $G$ are
       isomorphic.
     - If it is not injective, then there is $i>j$ so that
       $\varphi(i)=\varphi(j)$ \ie $g^i=g^j$, so $g^{i-j}=e$, so
       $n=\lvert g \rvert$ is finite.  Then $0\le r < n$ and $g^r=e$
       implies $r=0$, so $e,g,g^2,\ldots,g^{n-1}$ are $n$ different
       elements (otherwise $0\le j<i \le n-1$ would result $g^r=e$
       with $0<r=i-j$).
*** Proof (part 2)
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     Let $\tilde{\varphi}:\Z_n\to G$, where $\tilde{\varphi}(
     \overline{k} )= g^k =\varphi(k)$ for $\overline{k}\in\Z_n$.
     - Because $e,g,g^2,\ldots,g^{n-1}$ are all different and $\langle
       g \rangle=G$, $\tilde{\varphi}$ is a bijection between $\Z_n$
       and $G$, because both have $n$ elements.
     - $i\equiv j \pmod{n}$ means $i=nq+j$, so $g^{nq+j} =
       (g^n)^q\cdot g^j = g^j$ \ie $\varphi(i) = \varphi(j)$, \ie
       $\varphi$ is constant on the elements of one residue classes,
       which justifies the above definition.
     - It is also a homo\-morphism because
       $\tilde{\varphi}(\overline{i} + \overline{j}) =
       \tilde{\varphi}( \overline{i+j} ) = g^{i+j} = g^i \cdot g^j =
       \tilde{\varphi}( \overline{i} ) \cdot
       \tilde{\varphi}(\overline{j})$
*** Subgroups of a cyclic group
**** Remark
     - $\lvert g \rvert = n < \infty$ implies $\lvert\langle g
       \rangle\rvert = n$.
     - From now on, $G=\langle g \rangle$ means $G$ is a cyclic group
       with the generator element $g$.

     cyclic.
*** Proof
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     If $H=\{e\}$, $H$ is cyclic, and we are done.  Otherwise $\exists
     k \in\Z$, $k\neq 0$ so that $g^k\in H$. $g^k \in H$ implies
     $(g^k)^{-1} = g^{-k} \in H$, so we can assume $k>0$.  We will
     show that if $d=\min\{k\in\N^+ : g^k=e\}$ then $\langle g^d
     \rangle = H$.

     - $\langle g^d \rangle \subseteq H$: since $g^d \in H$.
     - $H \subseteq \langle g^d \rangle$: if $g^j \in H$, and
       $q=\lfloor j/d \rfloor$, $r= j \bmod d$ \ie $j=qd+r$, where $0
       \le r < d$. $g^j \in H$ and $g^d \in H$ implies $g^r = g^{j-qd}
       = g^j ((g^d)^{q})^{-1} \in H$ and since $d$ is minimal positive
       integer so that $g^d \in H$, $r$ has to be $0$ \ie $g^j =
       g^{qd}=(g^d)^q \in \langle g^d \rangle$.

     Let $G=\langle g \rangle$ and $\lvert G \rvert=n<\infty$.
     1. If $a\in\Z$, $d=(a,n)$ then $\langle g^a \rangle =
        \{g^d,g^{2d},\ldots,g^{md}\}$ which is the unique subgroup of
        $G$ of order $m$.
     2. If $H\le G$ then $H=\langle g^{d'} \rangle$ for some $d'\mid
        n$.
     3. $G$ has $\varphi(n)$ number of generators.
*** Proof
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     1.: If $d=(a,n)$ then $d\mid a$ ergo $g^a=(g^d)^j$ (for some
     integer $j$) so $\langle g^d\rangle \subseteq \langle g^a
     \rangle$.  By the extended Euclidean algorithm $d=ax+ny$, so
     $g^d=g^{ax+ny}=(g^a)^x(g^n)^y=(g^a)^x$, so $\langle g^a \rangle
     \subseteq \langle g^d \rangle$ ergo $\langle g^a \rangle =
     \langle g^d \rangle$.
     
     2.: Let $H\le G$ and $d'=\min\{n\in\N^+:g^n\in H\}$.  From the
     previous proof for $j=n$ in $g^j\in H$ we have $n=md'$ which is
     the unique subgroup of order $m$ for $d'\mid n$.  

     3.: $g^k$ generates $G$ if $(n,k) = 1$, and $\varphi(n)$ is
     Euler's totient function which returns the number of $k$'s
     relative prime to $n$.

     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a group, $H\le G$ a subgroup, and let us
     define the following two relations for $a,b\in G$:
     \begin{align*}
     a \sim_R b &\iff ab^{-1}\in H & a \sim_L b &\iff b^{-1}a \in H
     \end{align*}
     The equivalence classes defined by the $\sim_R$ relation are the
     *right co\-sets* and the classes defined by $\sim_L$ are the
     *left co\-sets* of $H$.
*** $\sim_R$ and $\sim_L$ are equivalence relations
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     Both $\sim_R$ and $\sim_L$ are equivalence relations over $G$, so
     they define a partition of $G$.
     - $\sim_R$ is reflexive: $aa^{-1}=e \in H$;
     - $\sim_R$ is symmetric: $ab^{-1} \in H$ implies $(ab^{-1})^{-1}
       = ba^{-1} \in H$; 
     - $\sim_R$ is transitive: $ab^{-1} \in H$ and $bc^{-1} \in H$
       imply $ab^{-1}bc^{-1} = a c^{-1} \in H$.

*** Index
**** Proposition
     Right co\-sets are of the form $Ha$ and left co\-sets are of the
     form $aH$ for some $a \in G$: $b\in Ha \iff \exists h\in H: b=ha
     \iff ba^{-1} = h \in H \iff ab^{-1} \in H^{-1} = H \iff a\sim_R
     b$. Similarly for $\sim_L$.

     :BEAMER_env: definition

     Then number of left and right co\-sets of $G$ is the same because
     $Ha \mapsto (Ha)^{-1} = a^{-1}H$ is a bijection between
     them. This number, if $<\infty$, is the *index* of $H$ in $G$,
     and is written as $[G:H]$.

     Let's work with right co\-sets. $\varphi_a(h)=ha$ is a bijection

     G: \lvert Ha \rvert = \lvert H \rvert$, multiplied by the number
     of co\-sets \ie the index $[G:H]$ gives all the elements of
     $G=\cup_{a\in G} Ha$
*** Consequences
**** Corollary
     Let $(G,\cdot)$ is a group, $\lvert G \rvert<\infty$: if $g\in G$
     then $\lvert g \rvert \Big\vert \lvert G \rvert$.
**** Corollary
     Let $(G,\cdot)$ is a group, if $\lvert G \rvert = p < \infty$ and
     $p$ is prime, then $\exists g\in G$ so that $\langle g\rangle =
     G$ \ie G is cyclic! This is true, because $\forall g\in G$ if
     $g\neq e$ then $(\lvert g \rvert, p)=1$ ergo $\langle g \rangle =
     G$. (Find the relevant theorem!)

     As can be seen from the definition (and the fact that $a \in aN$
     and $a \in Na$), the left and right co\-sets of $N$ are equal if
     and only if $N$ is a normal subgroup.

*** Properties of normal subgroups
**** Properties
     - Every subgroup in an Abelian group is a normal subgroup.
     - $G$ and $\{e\}$ are *trivial* normal subgroups. $N$ is a
       *proper* normal subgroup if $N\lhd G$ and $N\neq G$.
     - If $[G:N]=2$ then $N\lhd G$ since there are only two co\-sets
       $N$ and $G\setminus N$ \ie $a\in N \iff aN=N$ and $a \not\in N

     3. $\forall a\in G : a^{-1}Na \subseteq N$.

       \subseteq N$ for every $a\in G$ including $a^{-1}$, so
       $aNa^{-1} \subseteq N$ is also true, so $N=a^{-1}(a N a^{-1})a
       \subseteq a^{-1}Na$ is also true.
**** Corollary
    $N_i \lhd G$ for every $(i\in I)$ then $\cap _{i\in I} N_i = N

     non-empty set $X$.  Then the partitioning induced by $\sim$ (\ie
     set of co\-sets $\tilde{x} = \{y \in X : y \sim x\}$) is denoted
     by $X/\sim = \{\tilde{x} \subseteq X : x \in X \}$.  The
     operation $\ast$ is *compatible* with the partitioning $\sim$ if
     $x \sim x'$ and $y \sim y'$ imply $x \ast y \sim x' \ast y'$ (for
     any $x,x',y,y'\in X$).

     Then the operation can naturally be extended to co\-sets in
     $X/\sim$, by defining $\tilde{x} \tilde{\ast} \tilde{y} =
     \widetilde{x \ast y}$.  Usually we write $\ast$ instead of
     $\tilde{\ast}$.

     Any $(R,+)$ Abelian group (with the identity element $0$) can be
     made into a ring, by defining multiplication of any element
     $x,y\in R$ to be $x\cdot y=0$.  This multiplication is

    :END:
**** Proof							    :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     Let $(R,+,\cdot)$ be a ring, $o_+(x)=\min\{n\in\N^+:nx=0\}$ the
     additive order of $x\in R$.
     - $a, b \in R \setminus \{0\}$, $n=o_+(a)$. Then
       $n(ab)=(na)b=0b=0$, but also $n(ab)=a(nb)$, so $0=a(nb)$
       (why?), and since $a\neq 0$, $nb=0$.  So $o_+(b) \le o_+(a)$
       (why?).  By swapping $a$ and $b$ (how?) we have $o_+(a)\le
       o_+(b)$, ergo $o_+(a) = o_+(b)$ for any $a,b \in R \setminus
       \{0\}$.
     - The additive order of non-zero elements is finite or infinite
       at the same time.  Let $n=o_+(a) < \infty$, suppose $n=km$ and
       $m<n$.  $0=na=(km)a=k(ma)$, and by the definition of the
       additive order $ma\neq 0$, so $o_+(ma)=k=n$ (because every
       non-zero element has the same additive order), so $m=1$ has to
       be true \ie $n$ can not be composite.
*** Character of a ring
**** Character						       :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
     The *character of a ring* (without any zero divisors) is the
     additive order of non-zero element, if this is a finite value,
     otherwise $0$ \ie if $a\in R$, $a\neq0$ and $n=o_+(a)$ \[
     \operatorname{char}(R)=\begin{cases}n & \text{if } n < \infty
     \\ 0 & \text{if } n=\infty\end{cases} \]
*** The Frobenius transform
**** 
     Let an $R$ be a commutative ring without zero divisors.  If $n =
     \operatorname{char} (R) > 0$, then $n$ is prime and so: \[
     (a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}a^{k}b^{n-k} = a^n+b^n \]
     since for any $k$, if $0<k<n$, then $\binom{n}{k}= \frac{n\cdot
     (n-1)\cdots (n-k+1)}{k\cdot(k-1)\cdots1}$ is an integer, and
     since $n$ is prime it does not divide the nominator, but it
     divides the numerator, so $n \mid \binom{n}{k}$ that is
     $\binom{n}{k} a^k b^{n-k} = 0$ if $0 < k < n$.
     
     Then $F(x) = x^n$ is called the *Frobenius endomorphisom*.
** Sub\-rings and ideals
*** Sub\-rings, sub\-fields
**** Sub\-ring, sub\-fields
     Let $(R,+,\cdot)$ be a set with two operations and $S\subseteq R$.
     - $S$ is a sub\-ring (sub\-field) of $R$ if both operations
       restricted to $S\times S$ makes a ring (field),
     - if $R$ is also a ring (or field) then $R$ is an extension of
       $S$, written as $S\le R$.
     - If $S=R$ or $S=\{0\}$ then $S$ is a *trivial sub\-ring*.  If
       $S\neq R$ then $S$ is a *proper sub\-ring* of $R$.

     Let $(R,+,\cdot)$ be a ring and $\emptyset \ne S \subseteq R$,
     then the following are equivalent:
     1. $S \le R$ \ie $S$ is a sub\-ring of $R$;
     2. $a,b\in S$ implies $a-b\in S$ and $ab\in S$;
     3. $S-S\subseteq S$ and $SS\subseteq S$.

       $ra\in I$, then $I$ is a *left ideal*,
     - $ar\in I$ and $ra\in I$ (\ie left and right ideal) then $I$ is
       an *ideal*.
     - $R$ and $\{0\}$ are *trivial ideals*.  The ideal $I\neq R$ is a
       *proper ideal*.
     - A ring containing only trivial ideals is a *simple ring*.
**** Equivalent definitions
     - $I$ is a right ideal $\iff I-I\subseteq I$ and $IR\subseteq I$.
     - $I$ is a left ideal $\iff I-I\subseteq I$ and $RI\subseteq I$.
     - $I$ is an ideal $\iff I-I\subseteq I$, $IR\subseteq I$ and
       $RI\subseteq I$.
*** Generated ideals
**** Ideal generated by a subset
     - The intersection of ideals is also an ideal.  Let $R$ be a ring
       and $A\subseteq R$.  Then the *ideal generated by the subset $A$*
       is the intersection of all ideals containing $A$, written as
       \[ (A) = \cap \{ I : I \le R\text{ ideal} \land A \subseteq I\} \]
     - If $A = \{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \}$ then we write $(a_1, a_2,
       \ldots, a_n)$ instead of $(\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \})$.
     - If $A$ has only one element then $(a)$ is called a *principal
       ideal*.

     Let $R=\Z$, then $(R,+,\cdot)$ is a ring, and for any $m\in\Z$,
     $I=m\Z=\{mk:k\in\Z\}$ is a ring, since if $a\in I$, $a$ is a
     multiple of $m$, \ie there is a $k\in\Z$ so that $a=mk$, and for
     any $r\in\Z$, $ra=r(mk) = m(rk)\in I$ is also true. 

     $m\mathbb{Z}$ is also principal ideal generated by $m$ \ie
     $m\mathbb{Z} = (m)$.

     Let $R$ be a ring, and $I$ an additive subgroup of $R$, $a\sim b
     \iff a-b\in I$.  Since the additive group $(R,+)$ is Abelian
     group, the additive subgroup $I$ will be a normal subgroup.

     We say $a$ is congruent $b$ modulo $I$.  As seen with groups, the
     co\-sets generated by the equivalence relation $\sim$ are the
     sets $I+r$ for each $r\in R$, and these classes are the
     *co\-sets (or residue classes) of $I$ in $R$*.

     Let $(R,+,\cdot)$ be ring.
     1. If $I$ is an ideal in $R$, then the partition of $R$ by $I$ is
        compatible with both operations \ie $(I+a)+(I+b) =
        (I+(a+b))$ and $(I+a)(I+b)=(I+ab)$.
     2. If $\sim$ is a relation/partition of $R$ which is compatible
        with both operations, then the co\-set of the zero element
        $\tilde{0}$ is an ideal in $R$.

     1. Let $I$ be an ideal in $R$.  From groups, we know that the
        partition is compatible with addition.  For multiplication:
        $(I+a)(I+b)=II+aI+Ib+ab \subseteq I+ab$.
     2. Let $\sim$ be a relation, and also a partition of $R$ which is
        compatible with both operations, and let $\tilde{x}$ be the
        co\-set of $x$ \ie $\tilde{x}=\{y:x\sim y\}$.  From group
        theory we know that the partition by the normal subgroup
        $I=\tilde{0}$, we need to show that $I$ is an ideal.  Since
        $0\in I$, $\tilde{x} I \subseteq I$ for every co\-set
        $\tilde{x}$, and since the union of co\-sets is $R$,
        $RI\subseteq I$, \ie $I$ is an ideal.
*** Quotient ring
**** Remark
     In the first part of the proof, the $\subseteq$ can be a proper
     subset, \ie not equality. Example: Let $R=\Z$, $I=8\Z$, and
     $(8\Z+4)(8\Z+4) = 64\Z + 32\Z + 32\Z + 16 = 32\Z+16$, but $8\Z
     +4\cdot 4 = 8\Z + 16 = 8\Z$, so $32\Z+16 \subsetneq 16\Z
     \subsetneq 8\Z$.  This implies that the operation on the residue
     classes is not the same as the operation between sets.

     If $p$ is irreducible and $p\mid ab$, then if $ab=0$ then $a$ or
     $b$ is $0$, and $p\mid 0$.  Otherwise, if $ab\neq 0$, then
     $\exists d\in R$ so that $pd=ab$.  In this equations, if we write
     $d$ as a product of irreducible elements, $ab$ will be equal to a
     product which contains $p$, ergo if we write $a$ and $b$ as a
     product of irreducible elements, $p$ divides either $a$ or $b$
     \ie $p$ is prime.

     Let $R=\{a+i\sqrt{5}b : a,b\in\Z\}\subseteq \C$.  
     - For any integer $k\in\Z$, the value of $k^2 \bmod 5$ can be
       $0$, $1$ or $4$ (these are quadratic residues $\bmod\,5$),
       because $(5k)^2 = 5\cdot5k^2$, $(5k\pm1)^2 = 5\cdot(5k^2\pm
       2k) + 1$, $(5k\pm2)^2=5\cdot(5k^2\pm 5k) + 4$.
     - The square of the absolute value of an element $c=a+i\sqrt{5}b$
       is $\lvert c \rvert^2=a^2+5b^2$, so for each $c\in R$, $\lvert
       c \rvert^2$ can only be $0$, $1$, $4$.
     - $9=3\cdot 3$ but also $9=(2+i\sqrt{5})\cdot(2-i\sqrt{5})$.
     - $3\nmid 2\pm i\sqrt5$ nor $2 \pm i\sqrt5 \nmid 3$.  $3$, $2\pm
       i\sqrt5$ are irreducible, because $\lvert 3 \rvert ^2 = \lvert
       2\pm i\sqrt5\rvert ^2=9$, and if $d$ would divide any of the
       above elements, $\lvert d \rvert ^2$ would divide $9$.  But
       only the trivial divisors of $9$ are possible \ie only $1$ and
       $9$ are quadratic residues $\bmod\, 5$ (and $\lvert d \rvert^2
       = 1 \implies \lvert d \rvert = 1$).

     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     We want to show that there is a unique factorization (up to
     associated elements and commutativity).
     - The factorization exists: if $a$ is not irreducible, $a=bc$ and
       $\varphi(a) \ge \max\{ \varphi(b), \varphi(c) \}$.  Continue by
       induction on $\max\{\varphi(x)\}$, because either
       - the number of elements with $\varphi(a)=\max\{\varphi(x)\}$
         is reduced, or
       - the value of $\max\{\varphi(x)\}$ is reduced.
     - The factorization is unique: Let $a$ be an element with minimal
       value of $\varphi(a)$ so it has two different factorizations,
       $a=p_1p_2\cdots p_n$ and $a=q_1q_2\cdots q_m$.  $p_1 \mid a
       \Rightarrow \exists j: p_1 \mid q_j$. Since $q_j$ is
       irreducible $p_1$ and $q_j$ are associated, so the
       factorization of $a'=a/p_1$ is also not unique which is a
       contradiction, because $\varphi(a')<\varphi(a)$ which is
       minimal.

     - The field of fractions $K$ to the integral domain $R$ is the same
